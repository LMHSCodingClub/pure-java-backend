# Pure Java Back-End

Use this repo as a template for creating Java backend projects if you would like to not use a library (generally you
should use the library).

Run the following commands to start the server. Then, with the terminal still open (when you close it, it kills the
server), go to http://localhost:8080. This is your backend. To parse responses, it will require your own code.

```
mvn install
mvn exec:java
```
